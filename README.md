## ⚠️ Known Errors:
- Sometimes we get garbage output/response from the chatbot, it's due to some incompatiblity or some backend API issues that we've not been able to figure out yet. <b>But this can be easily resolved by reloading the site or restarting the streamlit interface.</b><br>(We figured that this must only happen because of some server-side issue)
